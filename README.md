If you schedule the Calendar event to run once a week, it will run the script once a week. You can completly stop emptying the trash can manually,   
and when its time for the script to run, a popup will ask you if you want to empty the trash can. You'll train yourself to stop emptying   
the trash can, so some day when you find that something is missing, you'll be able to use the trash can to check if you accidently deleted it.
